## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo contains one module, of many other modules all dedicated to different sections of the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

## Introduction ‚≠ê

The parser module can be used either in browser (client-side) or in Laravel php (server-side) environment. The parser module is used by other Summer CMS modules (such as the [Security module](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-security-module)) and in conjunction with custom Summer CMS API's to help process the data.

## Goals :soccer:

This module aims to identify the following details:

- Browser
- Layout engine
- Operating system
- Device
- Model
- Brand
- Platform
- Architecture
- Device pixel ratio (dpr)
- Device memory
- Viewport width
- Geo location
- Ip address
- Internet service provider (isp)
- Autonomous system number (asn)
- Hostname
- Host
- Referer
- Request
- Time Zone

(*) Note: The list above is not an extensive and complete list, it is intended to give a broad overview.

## Privacy Issues :sparkles:

The parser module follows strict privacy regulations set out in the GDPR, ePrivacy and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 

### Consent options ‚úîÔ∏è

The parser module allows users to give full consent options set out by the [Legal module](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-legal-module).

### Data rentention üóÑÔ∏è

There are options to configure the data retention period and the parser module follows the data retention policy.

### IP anonymization (or IP masking) üåé

The IP anonymization/masking takes place as soon as data is received by the parser module, before any storage or processing takes place.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-parser-module/blob/main/src/assets/images/ip.png"></p>

### Sensitive data üìí

The following personal data is considered **sensitive** and is subject to specific processing conditions:

- Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs.
- Trade-union membership.
- Genetic data, biometric data processed solely to identify a human being.
- Health-related data.
- Data concerning a person‚Äôs sex life or sexual orientation.

(*) Currently the parser module doesn't collect any personal data that is considered **sensitive** to be extra compliant to the rules.

### Encryption üîí

Article 32 of the GDPR includes encryption as an example of an appropriate technical measure, depending on the nature and risks of your processing activities. Encryption is a widely-available measure with relatively low costs of implementation. The data processed by the parser module is encrypted before being stored.

## Naming Prefix ‚úíÔ∏è

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements üö©

This module has been optimized to work with php `7.4.x` and `8.x` versions - we recommend upgrading from any lower php version.

**A full list of requirements to install Summer CMS, can be found here: [Summer CMS Requirements](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/README.md#requirements-).**

## Big data üìä

This module uses several Big Data tool sets to analyze large amounts of data collected from various Big Data sources to help detect and categorize. Some database sizes are in the petabytes and takes a few hours to run and process some models. These models are then used in our tests to improve the parsers detection rate. We also have various non-disclosed test severs running to gather various data and run tests to process the test data. This process helps us to build a more accurate parser module and helps to speed up the build process. We fully rely on using large amounts of data to build an accurate working parser used by some of the other Summer CMS modules!

### Notes

(1) Microsoft announced on 17 August that Edge Legacy will have its life support switched off on 9 March 2021, Summer CMS will support Edge Chromium only.

(2) Internet Explorer version 1-11, Summer CMS will not support due to only supporting `Evergreen` brwosers.

For a full list of browser support with Summer CMS, see here: [Browser Support](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/docs/browser_support.md).

## PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This parser module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/oc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/browser-stack.png"></p>

## PHP Coding Standards Fixer ‚≠ï

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one.

### Installation üîπ

The recommended way to install PHP CS Fixer is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in a dedicated `composer.json` file in your project, for example in the
`tools/php-cs-fixer` directory:

```console
$ mkdir --parents tools/php-cs-fixer
$ composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

For more details and other installation methods, see: [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

### Usage üî∏

Assuming you installed PHP CS Fixer as instructed above, you can run the following command to fix the files PHP files in the `src` directory:

```console
$ tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

(*) Change the above command to the correct folder location.

## Semantic Versioning üéÅ

The Summer CMS and all modules use: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/semver.png"></p>

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `X.Y.Z` where:

- X stands for a major version.
- Y stands for a minor version.
- Z stands for a patch.

The goal of Semantic Versioning is to bring some sanity to the management of rapidly moving software release targets. As discussed above, 3 numbers i.e, `Major`, `Minor` and `Patch` are required to identify a software version. For example, if we take version `5.12.2`, then it has a `major` version of 5, a `minor` version of 12 and a `patch` version of 2.

Below are some scenarios when Summer CMS creates a new version release:

- Bump the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Bump the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Bump the value of Z when fixing bugs.

Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the Semantic Versioning sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Then if another build is needed, it would become `1.0.0-alpha.2` and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.

Summer CMS uses the following pre-release metadata:

| Version     | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-aplha | The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing. |
| 3.3.x-beta  | The beta phase follows after the alpha phase. A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. |
| 3.3.x-rc    | A release candidate (RC), is a beta version with potential to becoming a stable product and is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. |
