## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo contains one module, of many other modules all dedicated to different sections of the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

## Introduction ‚≠ê

There are lots of many mediocre projects trying to tackle this subject and use either insecure cookies or dont even pass ePrivacy and GDPR laws properly. Laravel is a wonderful framework and we have built all the tools directly into the Summer CMS framework for developers and webmasters to easily create all their parser web pages for their websites and apps. Everything is fully customizable and takes very little time to setup.

The parser module has been fully optimized to work with `Desktop`, `Mobile`, `DPWA`, `PWA`, `AMP-HTML` and `AMP-HTML Stories`.

(*) More platforms will be added in the near future.

## Goals :soccer:

The parser module makes it easier to create and manage with custom built tools for the following:

- 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Notice
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Cookie Policy
- Copyright Notification
- Copyscape Plagiarism Policy
- Creative Commons License
- Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
- ePrivacy
- EU Representative
- EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
- GDPR
- Guidelines for Law Enforcement
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Master Services Agreement (MSA)
- Opt-In Policy
- Opt-Out Policy
- Privacy Policy
- Push Notification Policy
- Spam Abuse
- Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
- Terms and Conditions

## Privacy Controls :sparkles:

This module allows the website / app's external users to have full control of their privacy policies giving them all the correct infomation and controls to adjust their settings they way they want. The developer is given easy to use tools to setup the privacy controls, using a simple wrapper method on sections of code they wish to allow the end-users to be able to control. Webmasters can setup their privacy in no time at all, without needing to write any code at all, using the module's custom tools and be able to preview everything in the backend, without needing to switch to the frontend to preview the end result.

## Naming Prefix ‚úíÔ∏è

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements üö©

This module has been optimized to work with php `7.4.x` and `8.x` versions - we recommend upgrading from any lower php version.

**A full list of requirements to install Summer CMS, can be found here: [Summer CMS Requirements](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/README.md#requirements-).**

## Machine Learning :computer:

This module uses machine learning to help speed up creating the parser pages for your website / app and uses custom json datasets.

## PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This parser module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/oc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/browser-stack.png"></p>

## PHP Coding Standards Fixer ‚≠ï

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one.

### Installation üîπ

The recommended way to install PHP CS Fixer is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in a dedicated `composer.json` file in your project, for example in the
`tools/php-cs-fixer` directory:

```console
$ mkdir --parents tools/php-cs-fixer
$ composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

For more details and other installation methods, see: [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

### Usage üî∏

Assuming you installed PHP CS Fixer as instructed above, you can run the following command to fix the files PHP files in the `src` directory:

```console
$ tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

(*) Change the above command to the correct folder location.

## Semantic Versioning üéÅ

The Summer CMS and all modules use: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/semver.png"></p>

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `X.Y.Z` where:

- X stands for a major version.
- Y stands for a minor version.
- Z stands for a patch.

The goal of Semantic Versioning is to bring some sanity to the management of rapidly moving software release targets. As discussed above, 3 numbers i.e, `Major`, `Minor` and `Patch` are required to identify a software version. For example, if we take version `5.12.2`, then it has a `major` version of 5, a `minor` version of 12 and a `patch` version of 2.

Below are some scenarios when Summer CMS creates a new version release:

- Bump the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Bump the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Bump the value of Z when fixing bugs.

Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the Semantic Versioning sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Then if another build is needed, it would become `1.0.0-alpha.2` and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.

Summer CMS uses the following pre-release metadata:

| Version     | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-aplha | The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing. |
| 3.3.x-beta  | The beta phase follows after the alpha phase. A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. |
| 3.3.x-rc    | A release candidate (RC), is a beta version with potential to becoming a stable product and is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. |
